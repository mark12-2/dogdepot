      <pre class="prehome">
        Life on the streets is very hard and risky. 
        Some of stray dogs have a luck to live a long
        life because they have people who take care of 
        them. Many dogs from the streets needed help 
        and safe place in a shelter.

        Stated here in the<a class="btn" href="mvs.html"><u>MISSION - VISION - VALUES</u></a>
        our traits and objectives in order to make this 
        company a quality for everybody.

        In DogDepot, we ensure their safety and care until 
        they find their permanent guardians
        (however long that may take).
        We every day fight to provide food and medical 
        care for these rescued pets while actively 
        pursuing qualified forever homes for all of them.
